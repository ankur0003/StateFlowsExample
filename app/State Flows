State Flows

1. Replacement for LiveData
2. Live Data is not a replacement . it is just a new way of doing things on coroutines
3. State Flow needs to have an initial value whereas Live Data is not. Therefore, StateFlow is good and there will be no null value	
4. StateFlow will remain active when your is in background unlike LiveData which will become inactive
5. You can transform the result before you observe it
